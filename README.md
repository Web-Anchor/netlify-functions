## [Creating netlify functions](https://www.netlify.com/blog/intro-to-serverless-functions/)

To create a new Netlify function using Netlify's Lambda functions in VS Code with Puppeteer, you'll need to follow these steps:

### Set up a new project directory and initialize it:

- Open your terminal in VS Code.
- Create a new directory for your project: `mkdir netlify-function-example`
- Navigate into the newly created directory: `cd netlify-function-example`
- Initialize a new Node.js project: `npm init -y`

### Install Puppeteer:

- Install Puppeteer as a dependency: `npm install puppeteer`

### Create a Netlify function:

- Inside your project directory, create a new directory named netlify-functions: `mkdir netlify-functions`
- Inside the netlify-functions directory, create a new JavaScript file for your function, e.g., exampleFunction.js.

### Write the Netlify function:

In exampleFunction.js, you can write a sample Netlify function that uses Puppeteer. Here is an example of a function that takes a screenshot of a webpage using Puppeteer:

```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://www.example.com');
  const screenshot = await page.screenshot();

  await browser.close();

  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ screenshot: screenshot.toString('base64') }),
  };
};
```

### Create the netlify.toml file:

- The [build] section specifies the build settings for your Node.js project, including the build command (npm run build) and the directory to publish (dist).
- The [[redirects]] section defines a URL redirect from /old-url to /new-url with a 301 status code.
- The [[headers]] section sets the Cache-Control header for all files to ensure they are not cached.

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"  # Specify the build command for your project
  publish = "dist"  # Specify the directory to publish

[[redirects]]
  from = "/old-url"
  to = "/new-url"
  status = 301

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
    [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=0, must-revalidate"

```

### Deploy the function to Netlify:

- Make sure you have your project set up on GitHub and linked to Netlify for automatic deployments.
- Commit your changes to Git and push them to GitHub.
- Netlify will automatically detect the Netlify function in your project and deploy it.

### Test the function:

- Once deployed, you can test the function by accessing its URL provided by Netlify.

By following these steps, you should be able to create a new Netlify function using Puppeteer in VS Code and have it deployed and running on Netlify.
